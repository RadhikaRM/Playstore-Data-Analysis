# Playstore-Data-Analysis
Google Play Store is a major app distribution platform for Android users.Due to the availabilty of large number of apps,the competition in the app market is quite fierce.
Analyzing historical data can provide app development companies with valuable insights into the elements that should be addressed during the app development, as well as how to improve app performance and engagement. 

The aim of this project was  to identify the key factors responsible for app engagement and success by performing exploratory data analysis on the two datasets  provided:

1.Playstore apps data (PS_df): contains details regarding the category, rating and several other factors about the apps.

2. User reviews data (UR_df):the customer reviews for the apps. 

After performing the data cleaning, the impact of features like Type,Category, Price, Size Group, and Last Update Year on the Installs,Rating and Reviews are analysed
